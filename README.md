# TodoApp

TodoApp is a simple todo list application created using TypeScript and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This application allows users to keep track of their tasks and manage them efficiently.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can add new tasks to the todo list by entering a task description and pressing the "Add" button.
- Mark tasks as completed: Completed tasks can be checked off by clicking on the checkbox next to each task.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking on the delete icon associated with each task.
- Local storage: The app utilizes local storage to persist tasks, allowing users to access their todo list even after closing and reopening the application.
